# Vlitch

A basic webapp that uses the twitch api to fetch top streams for
specific games and then shows them. This was a test project to
try out phoenix some more and deploy to heroku. Also it was made because
I didn't have Flash installed and Twitch only provided flash based streams,
so I wanted a quick and easy way to get a link to use for [Livestreamer](http://docs.livestreamer.io/).

*Twitch now uses HTML5 for their streams so this little project is obsolete*

Can probably be seen up on: https://calm-caverns-5545.herokuapp.com/

To start your Phoenix app:

  1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  2. Currently no need for this step. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  3. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
